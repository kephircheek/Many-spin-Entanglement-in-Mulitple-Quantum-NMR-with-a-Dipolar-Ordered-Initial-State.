# Many-spin entanglement in multiple quantum NMR with a dipolar ordered initial state

E. B. Feldman, I. D. Lazarev

Multiple quantum (MQ) NMR with a dipolar ordered initial state opens new possibilities for the exploration of many-spin entanglement.
In this paper, we investigate many-spin entanglement in a gas of spin-carrying molecules (atoms) in nanocavities
in the conditions of MQ NMR with a dipolar ordered initial state.
The second moment of the distribution of the intensities of MQ NMR coherences,
which provides a lower bound on the quantum Fisher information,
is used for an estimate of the number of the entangled spins.
Many-spin entanglement is investigated at different temperatures and different numbers of spins.
